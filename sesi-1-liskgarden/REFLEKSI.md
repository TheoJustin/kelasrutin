## What have i learned
- I learned that on web3, You can own your data while you cant do that on web2 (write and read) or static websites that is only available for reading like web1.
- Web3 will come down to the use of transparency where all the transactions will be recorded and stored inside the layer RPC that you are using.
- I learned that every layer has the blockchain trilemma. Ethereum doesn't have the scalability, and Lisk isn't fully decentralized.
- Overall, I learned the fundamentals for solidity smart contracts (Variables, Require, Events, etc).
